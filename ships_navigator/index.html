          <h2 class='title'>"The Bombard"</h2>
          <p class='description'> Bombards are built by giff. The major feature of each ship is an enormous cannon that
            fires massive cannon balls capable of blowing other ships to smithereens. A bombard can carry up to fourteen
            giant cannon balls, each of which weighs 10 tons.
            These cannon balls make up most of the weight of the ship’s cargo. A winch mounted on the aft deck is used
            to load the cannon balls on board.

            A bombard can float and sail on water, but it cannot land safely on the ground (its keel would cause it to
            roll on its side).</p>

          <h2 class='title'>"Lamprey Ship"</h2>
          <p class='description'> Lamprey ships are antiquated, being among the oldest spelljamming ships still in use.

            Using the metal grappling jaws built into its bow, a lamprey ship can attach itself to another ship, which
            is a critical feature during boarding actions. Other standard weapons include four ballistae on the main
            deck.

            A lamprey can float on water, though it can’t land safely on the ground. Lamprey ships that land on the
            ground have the distressing habit of rolling over, as more than a few crews have discovered to their dismay.

          <h2 class='title'>"Nautiloid"</h2>
          <p class='description'> Built and used by mind flayers, nautiloids are designed exclusively for space travel.
            They can’t float on water, nor can they land safely on the ground.

            As an action, a creature attuned to a nautiloid’s spelljamming helm and in physical contact with the ship
            can transport the nautiloid and all creatures and objects aboard it to a different plane of existence, at or
            near a destination envisioned by the spelljammer (or to a random location on the plane if no destination is
            envisioned). This property is a feature of the ship, not the spelljamming helm. Each time this property is
            used, roll a d6. On a 5–6, the property recharges after 1 minute; otherwise, it can’t be used again for 24
            hours.</p>

          <h2 class='title'>"Nightspider"</h2>
          <p class='description'>
            Neogi terrorize Wildspace in ships of their own construction, which others call nightspiders. These vessels
            often wait in ambush for other ships. Once a target ship is identified, the neogi try to steal its
            spelljamming helm and capture its crew.

            A nightspider’s crew usually consists of nineteen neogi and up to a half-dozen umber hulks, which the neogi
            use as shock troops.

            Nightspiders are designed for space travel alone and can’t float on water or land safely on the ground (the
            weight of the ship would snap its spindly legs, destroying its weblike rigging in the process). Standard
            weaponry on a nightspider includes four ballistae (two forward-facing and two aft-facing) and a
            forward-facing mangonel.

          <h2 class='title'>"Scorpion"</h2>
          <p class='description'>
            Scorpion ships are archaic metal warships that have never lost their popularity, largely because of their
            versatility. Articulated legs enable a scorpion ship to land safely on the ground and move across a solid
            surface at a walking speed of 30 feet. The ship can’t float on water, however. A ballista is mounted on the
            top deck, and a mangonel is perched on the end of the tail. The ship’s two claws are relatively inefficient
            in combat, but a claw that grabs a creature can quickly take it out of action.

          <h2 class='title'>"Shrike"</h2>
          <p class='description'> This swift vessel is a relatively recent design, quickly gaining popularity with
            merchants and pirates. A shrike ship’s legs enable it to land safely on the ground. The ship can float but
            isn’t built for traveling on water and sinks quickly in rough seas.

            Standard weaponry on a shrike ship includes three ballistae—one on the forecastle, one in the middle of the
            top deck, and one on the sterncastle. In a desperate situation, the ship’s reinforced bow can be used as a
            piercing ram.

          <h2 class='title'>"Galleon"</h2>
          <p class='description'> The space galleon is a mainstay among the host of vessels that ply Wildspace and the
            Astral Sea. Space galleons can easily pass for ordinary seafaring galleons. Because they can land on water
            and move across it like their namesakes, they can sail into ports on terrestrial worlds without attracting
            undue attention. Like an ordinary galleon, a space galleon isn’t built to land on the ground (its keel would
            cause it to roll on its side). The ship’s standard weaponry includes two forward-mounted ballistae and an
            aft-mounted mangonel. </p>

          <h2 class='title'>"Squidship"</h2>
          <p class='description'> Among the oldest types of spelljamming vessels, squid ships are popular with
            privateers and are often used as patrol ships. Standard weapons on a squid ship include a forward-mounted
            mangonel, two aft-mounted ballistae, and a reinforced bow for ramming. The tentacles that extend from the
            bow account for nearly half the ship’s keel length.
            Squid ships can float and sail on water, and they can land on the ground.</p>

          <p class='description'> Star moths are ships constructed and flown by astral elves, who don’t like it when
            these ships end up in the hands of others.
            A star moth’s hull is fashioned from a grown and sculpted organic substance, and its enormous, decorative
            wings are made of shimmering crystal. The vessel is built for space travel, but its design does enable it to
            float on water or land safely on the ground. Standard weaponry includes two ballistae nestled in the star
            moth’s eye holes and a mangonel mounted above the bridge. </p>

          <h2 class='title'>"Flying Fish"</h2>
          <p class='description'> Aside from space galleons, flying fish ships are the most common vessels in Wildspace,
            favorites among merchants and adventurers alike.

            A flying fish ship can float and sail on water, but it isn’t built to land on the ground (the ventral fins
            would snap under the weight of the ship during landing, and the keel would cause the ship to roll to one
            side).

            Typical weapons on a flying fish ship include a forward-mounted mangonel and an aft-mounted ballista. </p>
